With this in mind we have developed our program to ensure that your staff and workers can access the most up to date documents and forms that you have available in a manner that eases the burden on your office staff to appoint that they can manage other parts of your business, such as customers, accounts and pays. </p>
                                    <p>This program intends to give you the freedom to choose what role we play in your need to get assistance with your document control, and the all important document access for your workforce both within your offices and or in the field. </p>
                                    <p>Online Safety and Training Institute Pty Ltd can also assist with the management of completed forms and timesheets and the like so again we free up your teams to get down to their core business on your behalf, how many of your supervisors complain of the "paperwork" and the time they are tied up doing it, we can help.</p>
                                    <p>Let us help your frontline supervisors and in field staff be confident that the documents they are accessing are the most up to date and relevant, and if need be, let us assist by doing some online filing for them, their time is probably better spent completing your work, than paperwork filing, you will be surprised how easy and cheap our proposals can be.</p>

                                    <p>At Online Safety and Training Institute Pty Ltd we understand that your front line supervisors are your most important asset, with this in mind we have developed our program to ensure their transition from "worker to boss" reflects this most important transition in their working lives.</p>
                                    <p>This program intends to give them tools that they may use long into their future to manage situations that may arise, although an important part of their arsenal, we feel it may be too late after an event to pull them out of the toolbox. In response to this belief all of these tools are explained and instilled upfront by our instructors in an endeavour to get them to reflect on how they got to where they are now, who were their positive influences, and the leaders that they witnessed along their journey they do not wish to follow. </p>
                                    <p>This program is best done in small groups with immediate follow up and assistance by an experienced mentor, at Online Safety and Training Institute Pty Ltd we understand that it is not the easiest role to be in - that is between the senior management team and their old workmates.</p>
                                    <p>Let us help your frontline supervisors be the best they can, in the long run, we feel this investment in your people will be repaid by their ability to achieve your goals and do it with a few less mistakes along the way.</p>

Then there is the filing of the training records, the maintaining of the training records to ensure everything is up to date and people get their relevant refresher training before their competency runs out, and that you can find the paperwork when you need it to prove the individual is competent either to a client and or regulator.</p>
                                    <p>At Online Safety and Training Institute Pty Ltd  we target your individual business needs taking costs as a key driver of business, with this in mind we investigate all avenues to provide our clients with the best possible returns for their training dollar.  </p>

                                    <p>Our model relies on you letting us know how much work you need us to carry out on your behalf and how much workload your own teams can manage and or have the skills and qualifications to assists in-house.</p>
